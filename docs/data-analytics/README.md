## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended)
- Internet connection for data fetching

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## üìà Example: Quick Start with Stock Data

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Download Reliance Industries data
reliance = yf.download('RELIANCE.NS', start='2020-01-01', end='2023-12-31')

# Plot closing prices
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(reliance['Close'])
plt.title('Reliance Industries Stock Price (2020-2023)')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price (‚Çπ)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
