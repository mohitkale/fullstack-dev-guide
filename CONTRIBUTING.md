## üé® Code Style

### General Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task

### React/React Native Specific
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer TypeScript interfaces over types
- Use prop-types for prop validation
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use meaningful component and file names (PascalCase for components)

### File Structure
- Keep related files together (component + styles + tests)
- Use index.ts files for cleaner imports
- Group related components in feature folders

## üìù Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): subject

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- **perf**: Code changes that improve performance
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples
```
feat(auth): add login with Google

- Add Google OAuth integration
- Update login page with Google button

Closes #123
```

## üîç Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any example files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. We may suggest changes or improvements.
5. Once approved, your PR will be merged into the main branch.
