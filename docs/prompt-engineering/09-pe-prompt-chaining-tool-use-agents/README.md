## 1. Introduction to Complex Prompting Paradigms <a name="intro-complex-paradigms"></a>
While single prompts are powerful, many real-world problems require a sequence of operations, access to external information, or the ability to act upon the environment. Prompt chaining, tool use, and agentic architectures extend the capabilities of LLMs significantly.

## 2. Prompt Chaining (Sequential Prompting) <a name="prompt-chaining"></a>

*   **Definition and Concept:** Prompt chaining involves breaking down a complex task into a series of smaller, manageable sub-tasks, each handled by a specific prompt. The output of one prompt in the chain often serves as the input (or part of the input) for the next prompt.

*   **Breaking Down Complex Tasks:** Identify distinct steps or stages in your overall goal.

*   **Passing Output as Input:** Design your prompts so that the output of prompt `N` is in a suitable format to be used by prompt `N+1`.

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Multi-step Reasoning:** Solve a problem by first extracting relevant information, then performing analysis, then drawing a conclusion, each with a separate prompt.
    *   **Data Transformation Pipelines:** E.g., Prompt 1: Extract raw data from text. Prompt 2: Clean and format the data. Prompt 3: Analyze the formatted data.
    *   **Iterative Content Generation:** Prompt 1: Generate an outline. Prompt 2: Expand a section of the outline. Prompt 3: Refine the expanded section.

*   **Examples:**
    *   *Task: Write a blog post about a new technology.*
        1.  **Prompt 1 (Brainstorming):** `"Generate 5 potential angles for a blog post about [New Technology]. Focus on benefits for small businesses."`
        2.  **Prompt 2 (Outlining - uses an angle from Prompt 1):** `"Create a detailed blog post outline for the angle: '[Selected Angle from Prompt 1]'. Include an intro, 3 main body sections with sub-points, and a conclusion."`
        3.  **Prompt 3 (Content Generation - uses a section from Prompt 2):** `"Write the introductory paragraph for a blog post based on this outline section: '[Intro Section from Prompt 2]'. Make it engaging and state the post's main thesis."` (Repeat for other sections)

## 3. LLMs with Tool Use (Retrieval Augmented Generation - RAG, API Calls) <a name="tool-use"></a>
LLMs' knowledge is limited to their training data. Tool use allows them to access and utilize external information or capabilities.

*   **The Need for External Knowledge and Capabilities:** For real-time data, proprietary information, or specialized calculations.

*   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):**
    *   **Concept:** Before answering a question or generating text, relevant documents or data snippets are retrieved from an external knowledge base (e.g., a vector database containing your company's documents). These retrieved snippets are then added to the LLM's context window along with the original query, enabling the LLM to generate an informed response.
    *   **Example Workflow:**
        1.  User Query: `"What are our company's policies on remote work?"`
        2.  System retrieves relevant policy documents from a vector store.
        3.  System Prompts LLM: `"Context: [Retrieved policy document snippets]
            Question: What are our company's policies on remote work based on the provided context?
            Answer: "`

*   **Prompting LLMs to Call External APIs/Functions:**
    *   **Defining Tool Specifications:** Describe the available tools (APIs/functions) to the LLM, including their names, purpose, required parameters, and output format. This is often done via a special section in the prompt or a system message.
    *   **Parsing LLM Output:** The LLM is prompted to indicate if it needs to use a tool and with what arguments. This output (often structured, e.g., JSON) is parsed by your application.
    *   **Feeding Tool Output Back:** Your application executes the tool call, gets the result, and then feeds this result back to the LLM in a subsequent prompt so it can continue its task.

*   **Examples (Illustrative API Call):**
    1.  **User:** `"What's the weather like in London and what's the capital of France?"`
    2.  **Prompt to LLM (with tool specs):** (Simplified)
        `"You have access to a tool: getWeather(location: string). You can also answer general knowledge questions.
        User query: What's the weather like in London and what's the capital of France?"
        Think step-by-step. Do you need to use a tool? If so, which one and with what arguments? If not, provide the answer directly.`
    3.  **LLM Output (example):** `{"tool_calls": [{"name": "getWeather", "arguments": {"location": "London"}}], "reasoning": "I need to use getWeather for London. I can answer the capital of France from my knowledge."}`
    4.  **Application:** Calls `getWeather("London")` -> gets `{"temperature": "15C", "condition": "Cloudy"}`.
    5.  **Second Prompt to LLM:** `"You called getWeather for London and the result was {"temperature": "15C", "condition": "Cloudy"}. The user also asked for the capital of France. Provide the complete answer to the user."`
    6.  **LLM Final Answer:** `"The weather in London is 15C and cloudy. The capital of France is Paris."`

## 4. Introduction to LLM-Powered Agents <a name="agents-intro"></a>
Agents take LLMs a step further by enabling them to make plans, use tools autonomously, and interact with their environment to achieve goals.

*   **What is an LLM Agent?** An LLM acting as the central controller (the "brain") of a system that can perceive, reason, plan, and act.
*   **Core Components:**
    *   **LLM as the Brain:** Processes information, makes decisions, generates plans.
    *   **Planning:** Breaking down a high-level goal into a sequence of actionable steps.
    *   **Tool Use:** Interacting with external tools (APIs, databases, code interpreters) to gather information or perform actions.
    *   **Memory (Optional but often crucial):** Short-term memory for the current task, long-term memory for learning and context.
*   **Simple Agentic Loops (e.g., ReAct: Reason + Act):**
    A common pattern where the LLM iterates through: Thought (reason about the current state and goal) -> Action (decide which tool to use or what to do next) -> Observation (get the result of the action) -> Thought ... until the goal is achieved.
*   **Prompting Strategies for Agent Behavior:**
    *   **Defining Goals and Objectives:** Clearly state the agent's overall purpose.
    *   **Instruction for Planning and Tool Selection:** Provide guidelines on how the agent should choose tools and sequence actions.
    *   **Handling Errors and Re-planning:** Instruct the agent on how to react if a tool fails or an action doesn't produce the desired result.
*   **Examples of Simple Agentic Tasks:**
    *   A research agent that takes a question, uses a search tool to find relevant articles, reads them (or summaries), and synthesizes an answer.
    *   A simple booking agent that asks a user for preferences, checks availability via a tool, and confirms a booking.

## 5. Frameworks and Libraries for Agents and Tool Use <a name="frameworks-libraries"></a>
Building these complex systems from scratch can be challenging. Frameworks exist to simplify development:

*   **Overview:**
    *   **LangChain:** A popular and comprehensive framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides modules for prompt templates, LLM wrappers, chains, indexes (for RAG), agents, and memory.
    *   **LlamaIndex:** Focuses heavily on data indexing and retrieval for RAG applications, making it easy to connect LLMs to various data sources.
    *   Other emerging frameworks and libraries.
*   **Benefits:** These frameworks abstract away much of the boilerplate code for managing prompt sequences, parsing tool calls, interacting with vector stores, and implementing agentic loops.

## 6. Challenges and Considerations <a name="challenges-considerations"></a>

*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is critical. What happens if a tool fails or an LLM in a chain produces an unexpected output?
*   **Latency and Cost:** Multiple LLM calls and tool interactions can increase latency and API costs.
*   **Security:** Giving LLMs access to tools, especially those that can perform actions (e.g., send emails, modify databases), has significant security implications. Careful sandboxing and permissioning are essential.
*   **Maintaining Coherence:** Ensuring the LLM maintains context and coherence across long chains or many agentic steps can be difficult.

## 7. Conclusion: Building Sophisticated LLM Applications <a name="conclusion-sophisticated"></a>
Prompt chaining, tool use, and agentic designs represent the cutting edge of what's possible with LLMs. By understanding these paradigms, you can move beyond simple Q&A or text generation to build more dynamic, knowledgeable, and capable AI applications that can interact with the world and solve complex problems.
